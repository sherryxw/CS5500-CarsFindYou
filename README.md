# Introduction

Buying a car is a laborious task. Usually, it takes people a lot of time and effort to search for matching cars, compare car specs and negotiate with dealers. To make this process more efficient, we decide to build a user-friendly car trading website. Unlike other websites where buyers find dealers, people can post their demands and expectations here and wait for dealers to match the posts.

### Tech Stack

- Database: MongoDB + Mongoose
- Backend: Express + Typescript + Auth0
- Frontend: React + Redux + Auth0 + Material UI

### Feature
- Users are supposed to select their identity as a dealer or buyer when registering at the beginning

- Buyers are the users who want to buy cars. Buyers can post their demands including brand, year, model, condition, mileage, color and affordable price range on the website and wait for dealers to contact them. 
- Dealers are the users who want to sell cars. They can search buyersâ€™ posts on the website and contact buyers if they are good matches.
