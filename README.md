# CS5500 final project - Cars Find You
## Introduction
Buying a car is a laborious task. Usually, it takes people a lot of time and effort to search for matching cars, compare car specs and negotiate with dealers. To make this process more efficient, we decide to build a user-friendly car trading website. Unlike other websites where buyers find dealers, people can post their demands and expectations here and wait for dealers to match the posts.
